1. Download adult_dataset.csv and adult_data.test
2. Change the paths to those two in the code, depending on which directory/path they are in.
What needs to be changed are the paths in the functions which make Dataframes from csv files.
Those are at the beginning of the code, dicrectly after the imports
3. Some part of running this notebook maybe time consumming. Cells related to Parameters tunning, evaluation and reduction of dimension is quite expensive computationally.
4. The following pakage are required to run this notebook:
seaborn
